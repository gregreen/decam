# Plan for tonight is to observe pass 1 in izy while the Moon is up, then switch to pass 1 gr for most of the night, then again switch to pass 1 izY in twilight. For calibration, we're planning
# on observing the DES SN C1 field at the beginning, and DECaPS1 for the end

First exposure of the night: 812379
Last exposure of the night:  812570


* Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.
* Sky looks completely clear on Rasicam at all points in
  the night. Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.
* No time for last 7 exposures; Finished all calibration exposures in
  twilight.Repeated the calibrations in g and r because the slew seemed to have taken less than before and I had just enough time left.
* Seeing was good (0.7-0.8) during the third quarter. It went up to 0.9+-0.1 in the 4th quarter.

Summary
=======

Photometric night. Seeing was good (0.7-0.8) during the third quarter. It went up to 0.9+-0.1 in the 4th quarter. Got calibrations at beginning and ending of observations (twice g and r at end of night, once izy). No time to complete last 7 planned exposures.

# Observing log for 2019-04-30
# Full night
# DECaPS survey on DECam
# Gregory Green
#
# Plan for tonight is to finish up gr on the extended footprint, to
# then fill in some of the holes in gr in the main footprint by
# redoing pass 3 near the Galactic Center with a corrected dither,
# then to do the same with a few izY tiles, and then to observe
# pass 3 of izY. There will be calibrations at the start and end of
# the night. The extra dither near the GC will serve as calibration
# in the middle of the night.

Log
===
* Clear skies at the start of the night. The Norwegians predict a
  cloudless night.
* Took calibrations in grizY during twilight.
* Seeing of first science observations is ~1.6" (similar to DIMM).
* At 02:15 UT, the sky is still clear, and seeing is around 1.5".
* At 02:45 UT, the sky is still clear, and seeing has decreased
  to ~1.1".
* At 03:45 UT, the sky is still clear, but seeing has returned
  to ~1.5".
* At 06:15 UT, the sky is still clear, and seeing is ~1.1".
* At 07:00 UT, the sky is still clear, and seeing is ~1.25".
* At 07:30 UT, the sky is still clear, but seeing has returned
  to ~1.8".
* At 08:15 UT, after moonrise, the sky is still clear, and
  seeing has fallen to ~1".
* At 09:00 UT, the sky is still clear, and seeing is ~1.25".
* Had to remove about two dozen exposures from the queue in order
  to catch up to the schedule.
* grizY calibrations in the morning. One long cloud visible, but
  possibly only condensation trails.

Summary
=======

Photometric night with poor seeing (~1.25-1.6" for most of the
night). No clouds visible on rasicam or on the webcams during
the night, but one long cloud visible during twilight. Not
sure if the end-of-night calibrations are okay.

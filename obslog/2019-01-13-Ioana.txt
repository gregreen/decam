# Observing log for 2019-01-13
# 2nd half of the night
# DECaPS survey on DECam
# Ioana Zelko
# 
#
# Plan for tonight is to observe pass 2 in gr for most of the night,
# and to switch to izY in twilight. For calibration, we're planning
# on observing the DES SN C1 field at the beginning, and DECaPS1 for
# the end

UTC 6:10 : some clouds on RASICAM on the horizon.  MARGINAL
UTC 6:14: clouds coming within 15 degrees of us...
UTC 6:21: we are doomed. BAD.
UTC 6:26: they are moving away.
UTC 6:29: a slice came by over us again
UTC 6:33: we are doomed again. BAD
UTC 7:07: it is clearer.
UTC 7:14: horrific again
UTC 7:30: MARGINAL
UTC 7:55: BAD - extra horrific
BAD until sun to -10; - it stopped tracking in the last 40 min

First exposure of the night: 811534
Last exposure of the night: 811864


Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.

* No time for last 5 exposures; Finished all calibration exposures in
  twilight. They were all during full coverage anyway so nothing good could have come out of this stuff. The telescope was not tracking in the last 40 min.
* Seeing was good before it got cloudy (0.9 +- 0.1), and then went up to 1.3+-0.2 for the third quarter, and to 1.5+-0.4 for the fourth quarter.

Summary
=======

Cloudy night. The first 1h15min were clear, after that most of the time was spent in bad cloudy conditions, with few exceptions. 

Seeing was good (0.9 +- 0.1) during the clear time,and then went up to 1.3+-0.2 for the third quarter, and to 1.5+-0.4 for the fourth quarter. and during the third quarter.  Got calibrations at beginning. I did them at the end as well, but there wasn't much point in doing  that - the tracking had stopped working in the last 40 min.  No time to complete the last 5 planned exposures.

# Observing log for 2019-01-09
# 2nd half of the night
# DECaPS survey on DECam
# Gregory Green
#
# Plan for tonight is to observe pass 1 in gr for most of the night,
# and to switch to izY in twilight. For calibration, we're planning
# on observing the DES SN C1 field at the beginning, and a field in
# the Galactic plane at the end of the night.

Log
===
* Some clouds low on the horizon at sunset, and also at the midpoint,
  when we take over. Rasicam looks good at the midpoint in the night.
  Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field).
* Rasicam still showing no clouds 3/4 of the way through the night.
  The webcam still shows some clouds low on the horizon, but
  telescope is pointing ~65 deg above the horizon.
* No clouds visible at end of night. The last few science exposures
  were taken near 10-deg twilight. No time for calibrations at
  end of night.

Summary
=======
Probably photometric night, with seeing between 0.8" and 1.4".
Completed all planned science exposures, and took calibration
exposures at the beginning of observations.

Plan tonight is to observe most of the tiles that don't yet have a photometric
observation. This will leave ~40 minutes free at the end of the night, during
which time we will observe a few fields in the DES footprint. At the beginning
of the night, we plan to take calibration exposures at b = 0 deg, in order to
better tie into the original survey.

Log
===
* Cirrocumulus clouds blanketing the sky at twilight. Taking calibration
  exposures at (l,b)=(300,0), but not hopeful about their photometricity.
* At 23:20 UT, clouds seem to be getting even worse. Cirrocumulus blanketing
  the sky, with cumulus clouds near the horizon.
* At 23:30 UT, clouds definitely worse. Looks like cumulus clouds across the
  entire sky. The DIMM seeing and flux are not stable.
* Stopped observing at 23:50 UT, because the sky was completely covered by
  cumulus clouds. Will be keeping an eye on the sky in order to see if
  conditions improve. Dome is being closed.
* Dome has been reopened. Restarted at 00:35 UT. Deleted observations from
  queue to catch up to schedule. The half of the sky that we're observing in
  has fewer clouds. The other half is still covered by high clouds. Our first
  pointing, however, is directly on top of a cloud.
* At 00:55 UT, the sky is looking much better. Clouds gone from most of the
  sky.
* Sky still looking clear at 01:25 UT.
* Sky still clear at 02:40 UT.
* Sky still clear at 03:14 UT.
* Sky still clear at 03:35 UT. PSF down to ~0.8".
* Observed at b = 0 with clear skies. Moved on to fields in DES footprint.
* A bit of cirrus in the last ~5 minutes. Not sure if it passed over
  our pointings.


Summary
=======
Everything up to 00:45 UT is bad. After that, the weather was good. The PSF
was ~0.8"-1.2" throughout our half night. Got DES fields at end of our
half night. Marginal weather in the last 5 minutes of our observations.

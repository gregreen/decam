# Plan for tonight is to observe pass 3 in izy while the Moon is up, then switch to pass 3 gr for most of the night, then again switch to pass 3 izY in twilight. For calibration, we're planning
# on observing the DES SN C1 field at the beginning, and DECaPS1 for the end

First exposure of the night: 813303
Last exposure of the night:  813520

The previous team finished their exposures 3.5 min late.
The slew from their position to our position took 4.7 min.

* Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.
* Sky looks completely clear on Rasicam at all points in
  the night. Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.
* No time for last 11 exposures; got calibration exposures in ending twilight.


* Seeing was  0.9-1.2 during the third quarter. It went up to 1.0-1.5 in the 4th quarter.

Plan tonight is to first observe the tiles from last night that were marred by
clouds. After that, we will observe the dither tiles near the Galactic Center,
fixing the dither pattern from previous observations. Time permitting, we will
finish up by observing the same DES calibration fields as last night.

Log
===
* Clear skies at sunset and start of observations.
* Began by observing (l,b) = (290, 0) at twilight, in order to tie into
  original survey footprint.
* Moved on to science fields on time. PSF is not good: ~1.6-2.5".
* At 23:30 UT, sky still clear, but PSF still poor: ~2".
* At 00:00 UT, sky still clear, and PSF has improved somewhat: ~1.5".
* At 00:30 UT, sky still clear, and PSF still ~1.5".
* At 01:23 UT, sky still clear, and PSF trending downwards: ~1.1-1.2".
* At 01:25 UT, moved on to fixing dither in original footprint near GC. The
  PSF is suddenly much worse (1.5-2.5"), possibly due to the wind picking up.
* At 02:00 UT, sky still clear, and PSF back down to ~1.1".
* At 02:36 UT, sky still clear, and PSF around 1.5".
* At 03:23 UT, sky still clear, and PSF around 1.5".
* At 03:52 UT, sky still clear, and PSF still around 1.5".
* Observed extra dither plan ("plan20190718-2") through tile DECaPS_43853_Y,
  and then switched to calibration fields in DES.
* Observed 3 of the DES calibration fields, aided by the kind donation of a few
  minutes from Alfredo.
* Still no clouds at the midpoint of the night. PSF still ~1.5".

Summary
=======
Clear skies throughout, but poor seeing, with the PSF bouncing around between
1.1" and 2.5", but close to 1.5" for the majority of the night. Observed
almost all the planned fields, but had to cut off the end of the extra dither
in order to make time for the pointings in the DES footprint (this was
foreseen). Should pick up "plan20190718-2" at tile 43911 next time.

# Plan for tonight is to observe pass 3 in izy while the Moon is up (most of the night), then switch to pass 3 gr for a bit, then again switch to pass 3 izY in twilight. For calibration, we're planning
# on observing the DES SN C1 field at the beginning, and DECaPS1 for the end

First exposure of the night: 813722
Last exposure of the night: 813958

The previous team finished exactly on time.
The slew from their position to our position took 3.5 min.

Tracking failing from time to time after 6UTC

* Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.
* Sky looks completely clear on Rasicam at all points in
  the night. Took calibrations (DES SN C1 field) for all wavelengths.
* No time for last 7 exposures; got calibration exposures in ending twilight.


* Seeing was  0.7-0.9 during the third quarter. It stayed similar for the fourth quarter, up until the last 1h when it went up to went up to 0.9-1.1.

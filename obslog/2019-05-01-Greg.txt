# Observing log for 2019-05-01
# Full night
# DECaPS survey on DECam
# Gregory Green
#
# Plan for tonight is to observe mostly in izY, and to redo gr
# pass 3 in some of the region near the Galactic Center where
# the previous dither pattern left unobserved strips. A very
# small number of pass 3 pointings in izY near the GC will also
# be done. There will be calibrations at the start and end of
# the night. The extra dither near the GC will serve as
# calibration in the middle of the night.

Log
===
* Some cirrus during evening twilight calibrations.
* Cirrus appears to gone not long after twilight on RASICAM.
* 3:00 UT: Clouds on horizon (RASICAM, webcam), DIMM flux
  fluctuating a bit.
* 3:45 UT: More heavy clouds on horizon.
* 4:25 UT: Some light blue haze on RASICAM passing over our
  pointing.
* 4:45 UT: Clouds gone from RASICAM.
* 5:30 UT: Some clouds on horizon again, a bit off from our
  pointing.
* 6:00 UT: Sky completely clear in RASICAM.
* 7:00 UT: Maybe one whisp, a bit away from where we're
  observing.
* 7:09 UT: Whisp gone.
* 7:30 UT: Still clear.
* 8:20 UT: Still clear.
* 8:50 UT: Some light clouds on horizon, but we're observing
  near zenith.
* 9:20 UT: Completely clear.
* Deleted ~25 pointings from ~beginning of last izY plan
  file in order to catch up to schedule.
* Some clouds near horizon, away from our pointing.
* During twilight, some cirrus visible near the horizon, but
  away from our science fields.
* Oil pump failed right as we were about to do morning
  twilight calibrations. No calibrations.

Summary
=======

Most of the night was photometric, with some light clouds
appearing at times, mostly on the horizon, away from where we
were observing. The seeing was remarkably stable at ~1".
Calibrations at start of night are questionable, due to
cirrus. Could not do end-of-night calibrations due to
mechanical problem.
